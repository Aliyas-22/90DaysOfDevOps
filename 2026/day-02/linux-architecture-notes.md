## LINUX

LINUX is open source operating system
okky so word is operating system which means a computer program that organizes the number of other programs at the same time..
basically linux was developed by linux torvalds who was working on unix but he notice one thing is unix was so costly so he decided to create
open sourse unix based system which is called linux in 1991..

# WE CAN USE LINUX IN DIFFRENT PLACES SUCH AS
-cloud (aws , azure , utho )
-wsl
-vm
-playground 

# so we are going to use AWS for learning linux
i created a ec2 instance with ubuntu os inside the aws after creating i connect it to ssh and there is my terminal..

now i am going to explain you about linux architcture:-
so remember it by using word which is [ASK]
 )-APPLICATION -> is basically a user
 )-SHELL -> is a interactive method to communicate with kernal
 )-KERNAL -> is a machine that undestand computer language 
   -(HARDWERE) -> take instruction

   ## process of linux
   suppose you have linux -> you switch on it -> then the process which is called                    --> so there is also kernal                    -> so basically
                                                  BIOS it is a motherboard that give power supply to     by using GNU-GRUB HARDWERE give instruction    you will see 
                                                  hardwere.                                              to kernal to load                              the loading ubuntu
                                                                                                                                                        this step is clled systemd
 -> d means DEMON  anything that runs in the background   -> so calling this process called 
                                                                systemctl (ex. systemctl docker)

## question??What systemd does and why it matters??

systemd is the first and important step in linux 
every other process comes after it and why it matter because 
systemd automatically start and stop every services

## commands of linux
pwd - present working directory
ls - list the directory
mkdir - to create directory
rmdir- to remove directory
touch - to create file
rm filename - to remove file
cp source destination - copy the file
mv source destination - move file
ip addr - to find ip address
free - to see memory
man - to know the command detial
htop - shows running process
df - to see how much memory is allocated
ps - to see process status
ps aux - show detailed of running process including background services
grep - to search somthing specific
